It\n   * might be for example a function that you passed to Observable's constructor, but most of the time it is\n   * a library implementation, which defines what will be emitted by an Observable, and when it be will emitted. This means\n   * that calling `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often\n   * the thought.\n   *\n   * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values\n   * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two\n   * of the following ways.\n   *\n   * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n   * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n   * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n   * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n   * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n   * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, if the `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n   * be left uncaught.\n   *\n   * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n   * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where the first function is equivalent\n   * of a `next` method, the second of an `error` method and the third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n   * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n   * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n   * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n   *\n   * Whichever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n   * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop the work that an Observable does and will clean\n   * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n   * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n   *\n   * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n   * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called.

then moves on to the next.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Concatenates multiple Observables together by\n * sequentially emitting their values, one Observable after the other.</span>\n *\n * ![](concat.png)\n *\n * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and\n * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of\n * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result\n * in Observable that completes immediately.\n *\n * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without\n * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will\n * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be\n * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,\n * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator\n * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other\n * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be\n * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.\n *\n * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,\n * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after\n * the one that emitted error, never will.\n *\n * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values\n * will be \"replayed\" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable\n * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,\n * you can always use {@link repeat}.\n *\n * ## Examples\n * ### Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10\n * ```javascript\n * import { concat, interval, range } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(4));\n * const sequence = range(1, 10);\n * const result = concat(timer, sequence);\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in:\n * // 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3 -immediate-> 1 ... 10\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate an array of 3 Observables\n * ```javascript\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer1 = interval(1000).pipe(take(10));\n * const timer2 = interval(2000).pipe(take(6));\n * const timer3 = interval(500).pipe(take(10));\n * const result = concat([timer1, timer2, timer3]); // note that array is passed\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // results in the following:\n * // (Prints to console sequentially)\n * // -1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> ... 9\n * // -2000ms-> 0 -2000ms-> 1 -2000ms-> ... 5\n * // -500ms-> 0 -500ms-> 1 -500ms-> ... 9\n * ```\n *\n * ### Concatenate the same Observable to repeat it\n * ```javascript\n * import { concat, interval } from 'rxjs';\n * import { take } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const timer = interval(1000).pipe(take(2));\n * *\n * concat(timer, timer) // concatenating the same Observable!\n * .subscribe(\n *   value => console.log(value),\n *   err => {},\n *   () => console.log('...and it is done!')\n * );\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // 0 after 1s\n * // 1 after 2s\n * // 0 after 3s\n * // 1 after 4s\n * // \"...and it is done!\" also after 4s\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link concatAll}\n * @see {@link concatMap}\n * @see {@link concatMapTo}\n *\n * @param {ObservableInput} input1 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * @param {ObservableInput} input2 An input Observable to concatenate with others.\n * More than one input Observables may be given as argument.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=null] An

fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const higherOrder = clicks.pipe(\n *   map(ev => interval(1000).pipe(take(4))),\n * );\n * const firstOrder = higherOrder.pipe(concatAll());\n * firstOrder.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n *\n * // Results in the following:\n * // (results are not concurrent)\n * // For every click on the \"document\" it will emit values 0 to 3 spaced\n * // on a 1000ms interval\n * // one click = 1000ms-> 0 -1000ms-> 1 -1000ms-> 2 -1000ms-> 3\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link combineAll}\n * @see {@link concat}\n * @see {@link concatMap}\n * @see {@link

Optionally takes a {@link SchedulerLike} for\n * managing timers.\n *\n * ## Example\n * Emit the most recent click after a burst of clicks\n * ```javascript\n * import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';\n * import { debounceTime } from 'rxjs/operators';\n *\n * const clicks = fromEvent(document, 'click');\n * const result = clicks.pipe(debounceTime(1000));\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x));\n * ```\n *\n * @see {@link auditTime}\n * @see {@link debounce}\n * @see {@link delay}\n * @see {@link sampleTime}\n * @see {@link throttleTime}\n *\n * @param {number} dueTime The timeout duration in milliseconds (or the time\n * unit determined internally by the optional `scheduler`) for the window of\n * time required to wait for emission silence before emitting the most recent\n * source value.\n * @param {SchedulerLike} [scheduler=async] The {@link SchedulerLike} to use for\n * managing the timers that handle the timeout for each value.\n * @return {Observable} An Observable that delays the emissions of the source\n * Observable by the specified `dueTime`, and may drop some values if they occur\n * too frequently.\n * @method debounceTime\n * @owner Observable\n */\nexport function debounceTime<T>(dueTime: number, scheduler: SchedulerLike = async): MonoTypeOperatorFunction<T> {\n  return (source: Observable<T>) => source.lift(new DebounceTimeOperator(dueTime, scheduler));\n}\n\nclass DebounceTimeOperator<T> implements Operator<T, T> {\n  constructor(private dueTime: number, private scheduler: SchedulerLike) {\n  }\n\n  call(subscriber: Subscriber<T>, source: any): TeardownLogic {\n    return source.subscribe(new DebounceTimeSubscriber(subscriber, this.dueTime, this.scheduler));\n  }\n}\n\n/**\n * We need this JSDoc comment for affecting ESDoc.\n * @ignore\n * @extends {Ignored}\n */\nclass DebounceTimeSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {\n  private debouncedSubscription: Subscription = null;\n  private lastValue: T = null;\n  private hasValue: boolean = false;\n\n  constructor(destination: Subscriber<T>,\n              private dueTime: number,\n              private scheduler: SchedulerLike) {\n    super(destination);\n  }\n\n  protected _next(value: T) {\n    this.clearDebounce();\n    this.lastValue = value;\n    this.hasValue = true;\n    this.add(this.debouncedSubscription = this.scheduler.schedule(dispatchNext, this.dueTime, this));\n  }\n\n  protected _complete() {\n    this.debouncedNext();\n    this.destination.complete();\n  }\n\n  debouncedNext(): void {\n    this.clearDebounce();\n\n    if (this.hasValue) {\n      const { lastValue } = this;\n      // This must be done *before* passing the value\n      // along to the destination because it's possible for\n      // the value to synchronously re-enter this operator\n      // recursively when scheduled with things like\n      // VirtualScheduler/TestScheduler.\n      this.lastValue = null;\n      this.hasValue = false;\n      this.destination.next(lastValue);\n    }\n  }\n\n  private clearDebounce(): void {\n    const debouncedSubscription = this.debouncedSubscription;\n\n    if (debouncedSubscription !== null) {\n      this.remove(debouncedSubscription);\n      debouncedSubscription.unsubscribe();\n      this.debouncedSubscription = null;\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction dispatchNext(subscriber: DebounceTimeSubscriber<any>) {\n  subscriber.debouncedNext();\n}\n","import { Operator } from '../Operator';\nimport { Subscriber } from '../Subscriber';\nimport { Observable } from '../Observable';\nimport { OperatorFunction } from '../types';\n\n/**\n * Emits the given constant value on the output Observable every time the source\n * Observable emits a value.\n *\n * <span class=\"informal\">Like {@link map}, but it maps every source value to\n * the same output value every time.</span>\n *\n * ![](mapTo.png)\n *\n * Takes a constant `value` as argument, and emits that whenever the source\n * Observable emits a value.
